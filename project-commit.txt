Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project:

1. Using GO, we can take advantage of Goroutines and channels for concurrency to create a exercise interval timer program.

2. Using Scala, we can take advantage of the pattern matching feature to create calculator to calculate some simple statistics. 

3. Using Erlang, we can take advantage of its concurrency features to create a messenger app.
